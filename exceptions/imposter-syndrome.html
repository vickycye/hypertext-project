                <h2>what this feels like</h2>
                <p>it hits hardest in moments when I should feel proud. got a good gpa? must have been the curve or an easy test. completed a difficult project? someone else could have done it better and faster. accepted into a program? they must not have had many qualified applicants. got an internship? the interviewer probably went easy on me.</p>
                <p>there's this constant background anxiety that I'm performing competence rather than possessing it. that there's a gap between how people see me and who I actually am, and any day now, someone will notice.</p>
                <p>the exhausting part isn't the fear itself, but it's the vigilance. always monitoring, always prepared for exposure, never quite allowing myself to relax into my own accomplishments.</p>

                <h2>why this happens</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>academia:</strong> everyone around me seems naturally brilliant while I'm just working hard. </li>
                    <li><strong>perfectionism:</strong> if I make one mistake, maybe all my other work is invalid too.</li>
                    <li><strong>rapid learning curve:</strong> CS moves fast. there's always something I don't know, which feels like everything I should know.</li>
                    <li><strong>comparison culture:</strong> tech twitter, LinkedIn humble-brags, peer accomplishments. these provide infinite fuel for inadequacy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>In Industry</h3>
                <p>"did I actually deserve this offer, or did I just interview well? what happens when they realize I don't know as much as they thought?"</p>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>every code review feels like a test I might fail.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>I read the comments three times before responding, trying to figure out if they're pointing out something obvious I should've known. Is this feedback or judgment? Am I improving or just confirming I don't belong here?</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>In Academia</h3>
                <p>"every other student seems to have read papers I've never heard of. how did I get into the same program as them?"</p>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>maybe I'm just not cut out for research.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>they ask questions in class that I hadn't heard before. they cite authors casually like everyone should know them. I nod along, pretending I'm following, googling everything later in private. what if the admissions committee made a mistake?</p>
                    </div>

                <h3>In The Startup World</h3>

                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>fake it til you make it, but what if I never make it?</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>every pitch feels like a performance. every investor question feels like they're about to expose that I'm just a student with an idea, not a founder with a vision. the confidence I project isn't real yet.</p>
