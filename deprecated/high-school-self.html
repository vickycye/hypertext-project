                <h2>who that was</h2>
                
                <h3>slightly obsessed with video games</h3>
                <p>i came back from school and played hours of valorant, to where I can recognize a location on the map from a sound effect.</p>

                <h3>the joker?</h3>
                <p>i was always the "funny kid" in class, but looking back, I don't think I was the most respectful person.</p>

                <h3>comfort zone dweller</h3>
                <p>i sticked to things i liked. i sticked to things that were easy, and i stuck to things that were safe. but without risk-taking there would be no growth.</p>

                <h3>assumptions</h3>
                <p>i made a lot of assumptions about people and situations, and i wasn't the most accepting person back then. </p>

                <h2>the story of loss</h2>
                <p>after losing a loved one in the middle of my sophomore year of high school, I realized that I was living in a bubble. I was very focused on the current moment and didn't plan much for the future. 
                    I started connecting with my parents more, started reaching out to old friends from elementary/middle school, and started to pave a path for myself for the next 10 years.

            <section>
                <h2>what changed?</h2>
                
                <h3>from gaming obsession to intentional play</h3>
                <p>i started to realize that I was using video games as an escape from reality, and I started to play them more intentionally. I started to play them with a purpose, and I started to play them with a plan.</p>

                <h3>from being goofy to being serious</h3>
                <p>i realized that I should become more serious about my work, how I present myself, and how I treat others.</p>

                <h3>from comfort to growth</h3>
                <p>i started to take risks, and i started to push myself out of my comfort zone by trying new things and challenging myself.</p>

                <h3>from assuming to accepting</h3>
                <p>i started to accept people for who they are, and i also started to accept myself for who I am in the moment without trying to shape myself into something I'm not.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>what I still carry</h2>
                <p>i still have that same sense of humor, and I still love video games. but I'm also more aware of the time I'm spending on them, and I'm more intentional about how I'm using them.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>the tension</h2>
                <p>often I think about the days back in high school, and how wonderful they were because I was so carefree and didn't have to worry about anything. but I also think about the days now, and how much I've grown and changed, and that's wonderful too.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>reflection</h2>
                <p>"that version of me is deprecated, but not deleted. the code still exists in the repository, even if it's not actively running. sometimes I catch myself falling back into old patterns, and I have to remind myself: that function is deprecated. use the new one."</p>
