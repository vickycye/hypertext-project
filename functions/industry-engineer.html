                <h2>A Day in This Life</h2>
                
                <h3>Morning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wake up at 7:30 AM, morning routine with coffee</li>

                    <p>The routine is comforting. Until it isn't.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">

                <ul>
                    <li>Finish work around 6 PM (usually)</li>

                <h2>The Returns (What You Gain)</h2>
                
                <h3>Financial Security</h3>
                <p>Competitive salary, benefits, 401k, stock options. Ability to save, invest, travel. Financial independence from family.</p>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>Money doesn't buy happiness, but it buys options.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>[Reflection on financial security]</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Technical Growth</h3>
                <p>Work with large-scale systems. Learn from senior engineers. Access to latest tools and technologies. Respected professional identity.</p>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>I'm getting better at engineering. But at what?</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Stability</h3>
                <p>Clear career progression. Job security (relatively). Predictable lifestyle. Work-life boundaries (mostly).</p>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>Stability is underrated. Until it feels like stagnation.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>[Reflection on stability]</p>

                <h2>The Side Effects (What You Sacrifice)</h2>
                
                <h3>Creative Expression</h3>
                <p>Work on assigned features, not own ideas. Limited control over product direction. Creativity within constraints. Personal projects on the side (if energy remains).</p>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>The drawings sit in a folder, unfinished.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>[Reflection on creative sacrifice]</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Autonomy</h3>
                <p>Work on company priorities. Manager relationships matter. Corporate politics exist. Trade independence for resources.</p>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>When did I start asking permission to build things?</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>[Reflection on autonomy]</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Risk Aversion</h3>
                <p>Golden handcuffs are real. Harder to leave over time. Lifestyle inflation. Safety becomes default.</p>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>The longer I stay, the harder it is to imagine leaving.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>[Reflection on risk aversion]</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
                <p>"This is the 'safe' path everyone talks about. The one that makes sense on paper. Good salary, interesting problems, work-life balance—at least compared to startups or academia. I can see myself here, comfortable and competent.</p>
                <p>But there's a voice that asks: Is this enough? Will I wake up at 35 with a nice savings account and a nagging feeling that I played it too safe? That I optimized for comfort over meaning?</p>
                <p>Maybe that voice is just romantic idealism. Maybe comfort is underrated. Maybe the people who chase passion are the lucky few, not the norm.</p>
                <p>Or maybe I'm just afraid to want more."</p>
