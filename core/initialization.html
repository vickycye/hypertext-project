                <h2>my roots</h2>
                <p> I was born in pennsylvania, but moved states 5 times before I settled in washington at age 7. 
                    I didn't have access to electronic devices until I was 5, but once I did, I was immeditately hooked.
                    I picked up video games, and I've been playing them ever since. 
                    my parents enrolled me in several drawing classes and computer science classes for young kids, 
                    to "balance out the two halves of [my] brain." so, I've known that I wanted to pursue computer science
                    since a very young age, but I came to UW not knowing exactly what I wanted to do in cs.

                <h2>the path to now</h2>
                <p> my early interests in drawing and visual thinking have evolved into an interest in ui/ux, then to design in coding.
                    my passion for gaming turned into a knack for problem-solving and logical thinking in programming, as well as concisely communicating with teammates. 
                    finally, I've come to realize that I want to make things. I want to build. so I'm pursuing a STEM career in computer science, hoping to make a difference in the world.
