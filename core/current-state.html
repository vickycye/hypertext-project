                <h2>intro</h2>
                <p> my name is vicky ye, and I'm a computer science student at the university of washington.
                    I'm currently in my sophomore year, and although there have been ups and downs, I'm loving it so far.
                    but sometimes, I've asked myself: "is this really where I want to be? is this what I want to do?"
                    keep exploring to find out...

                <p> I've sprung head-first into a tech world, but I feel like I'm losing the creative side of myself. 
                    I want to focus on the present, and "lock in" on my current duties, but I can't help but keep planning for the future.
                    I want a stable career, but there's also a certain amount of risk-taking that I'm not willing to give up, even if it's scary.
