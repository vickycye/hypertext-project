                <h2>what this feels like</h2>
                <p>it starts subtly: projects that used to excite me start feeling like obligations. the code editor stays closed. deadlines approach and instead of the usual panic that forces action, there's just... nothing. a flat, heavy nothing. I know I should get up, should start working, should care. but the bed feels safer than facing another task I don't have energy for.</p>
    
                <p>everything requires too much effort. responding to messages. showing up to class. the gap between what I need to do and what I can do grows wider each day. i'm not lazy. there's a difference, but it's hard to explain to people who haven't felt it.</p>
                
                <p>the worst part isn't the exhaustion itself. it's the guilt that comes with it. watching deadlines come closer and closer. knowing I'm letting myself down. the voice that says "goddamnit vicky, get your shit together" gets louder while my ability to answer it gets quieter. </p>

                <h2>coping mechanisms</h2>
                <p>i've taken a different direction. I no longer play video games to cope, but I take breaks and relax. I've also started to prioritize both my mental and physical health more. those small little walks in the morning and meditation really do help.</p>

                <p>"can I ever fully resolve this, or is it something I learn to carry?"</p>
