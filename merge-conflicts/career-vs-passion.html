                <h2>Why Both Matter</h2>
                <p><strong>The Career Path:</strong> I worked hard for these technical skills. Software engineering is intellectually challenging, pays well, and offers a clear path forward. My family would be proud. I'd be financially independent. Student loans would disappear. I could travel, invest, not worry about rent. There's dignity in building things that work at scale, in solving real problems, in being competent and compensated fairly for it.</p>

                <p><strong>The Passion Path:</strong> But I didn't get into technology just for the paycheck. I was drawn to creating: building experiences, designing interfaces, making things beautiful and meaningful. The childhood drawings never went away; they just got digital. The most alive I feel is when code becomes art, when I'm designing something that makes someone feel something, when I'm creating rather than just engineering solutions to someone else's problems.</p>

                <h2>The Tension in Daily Life</h2>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p><strong>During job applications:</strong> "Should I apply to design studios or tech companies? Both? Does applying to both mean I'm not committed to either?"</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>Every application feels like a vote for one future over another. I'm hedging my bets, which probably means I don't believe in either path enough.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p><strong>Looking at my projects:</strong> "Why are all my side projects creative, but my resume is pure engineering?"</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>The things I build for myself versus the things I show employers—they're completely different. What does that say about who I am versus who I think I need to be?</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p><strong>Seeing others' work:</strong> "When I see beautiful, creative work, I feel envy. When I see impressive engineering work, I feel inadequate."</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>I'm jealous of people in both directions. The designers who get to focus on aesthetics. The engineers who don't question whether their work has soul. Meanwhile I'm stuck in the middle, not enough of either.</p>

                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>I've learned which parts of my work get approval and which get confused looks. It's easier to just talk about the conventional path.</p>

                <h2>Attempted Resolutions</h2>
                
                <h3>Compromise: Creative Technologist Role</h3>
                <p><strong>The idea:</strong> Find a role that bridges both—design engineering, creative coding, interactive media, product design at the intersection of art and technology.</p>
                <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> These roles are rare, often require both a strong portfolio and technical chops, and typically pay less than pure engineering. They exist at the edges: experimental agencies, design studios, research labs. Not the places recruiting on campus.</p>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Can work, but requires hustle, luck, and usually living in expensive creative hubs. Not a "safe" path by any definition.</p>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>This sounds perfect on paper.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>But what if it's just a way to avoid choosing? What if "creative technologist" is shorthand for "can't commit to either"? Or what if it's the only authentic answer, and I'm just scared to pursue it?</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Sequential: Engineering First, Creativity Later</h3>
                <p><strong>The idea:</strong> Establish financial security with an engineering job for 5-10 years, build savings, then transition to creative work once stable. "Do what pays, then do what matters."</p>
                <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Golden handcuffs are real. Lifestyle inflation happens. Energy after a full day of work depletes. The creative muscles atrophy from disuse. Five years becomes ten becomes never.</p>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Many people plan this. Very few execute it. The gap between "eventually" and "now" grows wider each year.</p>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>"Later" sounds responsible and practical.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>But "later" has a way of never arriving. And what if by the time I'm financially stable, I've forgotten how to create? What if the person who can afford to be creative is no longer the person who wants to be?</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Integration: Creative Engineering Work</h3>
                <p><strong>The idea:</strong> Find engineering work that has creative elements—frontend development, UI implementation, design systems, developer tools with great UX. Scratch both itches within one role.</p>
                <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> It's still fundamentally engineering. The creative parts are constrained by product requirements, technical debt, and stakeholder opinions. You're making someone else's vision beautiful, not creating your own.</p>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Satisfies neither impulse fully, but it's sustainable. A livable compromise that might feel like settling, or might feel like wisdom. Hard to know which until you're in it.</p>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>Maybe this is the mature answer.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>But is it maturity or just giving up? Is this what growth looks like—accepting that you can't have everything? Or is it what surrender looks like—choosing comfort over conviction?</p>
