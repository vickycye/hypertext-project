                <p class="subtitle">Recursion stops here. Keep recursing through life experiences, but these constants remain true.</p>

                <h2>The Question</h2>
                <p>"If I strip away all the variables: the major, the career path, the location, the relationships, what remains? What are the base cases that define who I am, regardless of which function I call?"</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Constants</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Curiosity</h3>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>I need to understand how things work.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>This will never go away, and I don't want it to. Every field I explore, every problem I encounter, there's always that spark of "but how?" This means I'll never be bored. There's always something new to learn, always another layer to uncover. This is a gift.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>2. Care About Others' Experience</h3>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>I want the things I build to make people's lives better.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>Whether it's an interface, an explanation, or just a conversation. I genuinely care how others experience things. This means I'll never build something purely technical without thinking about the human on the other side. That's not a weakness; it's what makes the work matter.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>3. Need for Meaning</h3>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>I can't just do things because they're profitable or prestigious.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>Some people see this as a burden, but I see it as a compass. This need for meaning will keep me from wasting years on work that doesn't matter. It's a filter that helps me say no to the wrong things so I can say yes to the right ones.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>4. Creative Expression Drive</h3>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>I need to make things, not just consume them.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>From childhood drawings to code to design, the medium changes but the impulse stays the same. I'm a builder. That means every path I take will have opportunities to create. This isn't something I have to choose; it's something I get to bring with me wherever I go.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>5. Growth Orientation</h3>
                <div class="hoverable">
                    <p>I'm never satisfied staying where I am.</p>
                    <div class="hover-content">
                        <p>After everything that's shaped me, I can't go back to unconscious living. This restlessness isn't a problem. It means I'll keep pushing, keep learning, keep becoming. Some people plateau. I won't. That's not arrogance; it's just who I am now.</p>

                <h2>The Liberating Realization</h2>
                <p>"If these are my constants, then maybe the specific path doesn't matter as much as I think. Maybe I can find these things in industry, or academia, or a startup, or creative work. Maybe the question isn't 'which path?' but 'how do I honor these constants in whatever path I choose?'"</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Scary Part</h2>
                <p>"But what if I'm wrong? What if these aren't really constants, just preferences I've convinced myself are fundamental? What if I change, and then I've built my whole identity on shifting sand?"</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>"Maybe that's okay. Maybe the base case isn't about finding something that never changes, but about recognizing what matters most right now. And if it changes later, that's not failure—that's just another iteration of the recursive function that is becoming who I am."</p>
