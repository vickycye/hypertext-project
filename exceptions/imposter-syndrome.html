                <h2>What This Feels Like</h2>
                <p>It hits hardest in moments when I should feel proud. Got a good grade? Must have been luck or an easy test. Completed a difficult project? Someone else could have done it better and faster. Accepted into a program? They must not have had many qualified applicants.</p>
                <p>There's this constant background anxiety that I'm performing competence rather than possessing it. That there's a gap between how people see me and who I actually am, and any day now, someone will notice.</p>
                <p>The exhausting part isn't the fear itself—it's the vigilance. Always monitoring, always prepared for exposure, never quite allowing myself to relax into my own accomplishments.</p>

                <h2>Why This Happens</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Academic context:</strong> Everyone around me seems naturally brilliant while I'm just working hard. The survivorship bias of college—we're all selected for being good at this, so of course everyone seems capable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perfectionism:</strong> If I make one mistake, maybe all my other work is invalid too.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid learning curve:</strong> CS moves fast. There's always something I don't know, which feels like everything I should know.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comparison culture:</strong> Tech Twitter, LinkedIn humble-brags, peer accomplishments—infinite fuel for inadequacy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>In Industry</h3>
                <p>"Did I actually deserve this offer, or did I just interview well? What happens when they realize I don't know as much as they thought?"</p>

                <p>"Every other student seems to have read papers I've never heard of. How did I get into the same program as them?"</p>
                <div class="hoverable">
